<h1>The (Unofficial) Website of Suzanne Collins</h1>
<p>
  Suzanne Collins is the author of the wildly popular <em>Hunger Games</em> series. <a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/" target="_blank">Here's her <em>actual</em> official website.</a>
</p>
<p>Yeah. It's <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to give it a <a href="https://joshuaakins1108.github.io/suzanne-collins-project" target="_blank">makeover</a> as my first real web development project.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm pretty happy with how it looks so far, but I'm open to any and all suggestions, so fork away. :)</p>
<p>In particular, I would like the mobile formatting to be a bit tighter.</p>
